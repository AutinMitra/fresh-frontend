## What is Fresh?
Fresh is a tool that is used to record and display locations of trash found outside.    

## Why?     
Scientists approximate we have 5-6 years left to save the environment. We created Fresh to combat this problem. 
With Fresh, users are able to identify locations where trash may be prevalent, and take initiative into their own hands to combat the problem.
Be believe that with the help of the community using Fresh, the issues of climate change may be mitigated.

## What technologies does it use?    
We used Flutter for the mobile app and used [object_detection](https://github.com/rupakkarki27/object_detection) to detect trash in an image.     
For the back-end, 
For the front-end visuals, we used GatsbyJS with theme-ui. We used [google-map-react](https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react) to display the map and [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for fancy animations.      

## How does it work?   
Using a multitude of aforementioned technologies, Fresh first indentifies trash from an image. Fresh then uses different clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, OPTICS, and KMEANS) to determine trash locations. Fresh them compiles the locations and indetifies clusters of and displays them to the user, allowing them to take initiative to help their community.

## What improvements can be made?  
None it is perfect.
